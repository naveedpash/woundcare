# Introduction

## Operational Definitions

- Wound Size:

    Maximum dimension of the wound in length, width and depth

- Diabetic Patient: 

    Patients with elevated serum glucose level as defined by (_ guidelines):
    - Documented fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL
    - Documented random blood glucose level > 200 mg/dL
    - Documented HbA1c > 6.5 mg/dL
    - Taking oral hypoglycemic agents
    - Taking subcutaneous insulin injection

- Blood Glucose Level: level of blood glucose measured by point of care glucometer

- Glycemic control:

    Monthly average of weekly fasting blood glucose level measured by point-of-care glucometer

- Cigarette Use:

    Number of cigarettes smoked per today

- Standard Dressing:

    The practice of applying povidone-iodine to wound edges followed by washing wounds
    with at least 500 cc of normal saline before applying gauze in a clean or
    sterile fashion

- EUSOL Dressing:

    The practice of applying povidone-iodine to wound edges followed by washing
    wounds with at least 500 cc of normal saline before applying gauze soaked in
    EUSOL in a clean or sterile fashion

- Opportunistic EUSOL dressing:

    The practice of applying povidone-iodine to wound edges followed by washing
    wounds with at least 500 cc of normal saline before applying gauze in
    a clean or sterile fashion; the gauze will be soaked in EUSOL if the wound
    base contains fibrinous slough
    
- Wound Slough

    Fibrinous deposits on the base and/or edges of the wound typically white or
    pale yellow in colour as determined by two separate and experienced wound
    care practitioners

- Wound Care Practitioner

    Nurses and doctors with at least one year of experience in dressing
    surgical wounds healing by secondary intention

- Healed Wound

    Wound that has completely epithelialised as determined by two separate and
    experienced wound care practitioners or a wound that is considered ready for
    definitive closure by surgery as determined by the patient's surgeon.

## Primary Objective

To identify the presence of a statistically significant difference in wound
healing rate and cost of wound dressing between EUSOL dressing, opportunistic
EUSOL dressing and standard dressing of wounds healing by secondary intention.

## Secondary Objectives

To identify the presence of a statistically significant difference in wound
healing rate between EUSOL dressing and opportunistic EUSOL dressing
of wounds healing by secondary intention.

To identify the presence of a statistically significant difference in average
monthly cost of dressing between standard dressing and EUSOL dressing
of wounds healing by secondary intention.

# Materials and Methods

## Study Setting

This study will be conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital.

## Duration of Study

The human skin heals at a rate of 0.5 - 1 mm per day. Some of the largest wounds
treated at the setting of this study are 60 cm (600 mm). Therefore, the largest
wounds of this study may be expected to heal in approximately 19 months (or
little more than 1.5 years).

The study will be conducted until all patients of the study achieve wound
healing is achieved as defined previously. The Aga Khan University Hospital
treats on average 14 patients every month with wounds healing by secondary
intention. Therefore this study will have enrolled its sample size in one year
and will be expected to have achieved the end point in another 1.5 years maximum
for a total study duration of 2.5 years.

## Sample Size

Calculate sample size based on difference in healing expected...

## Sample Selection

Patients will be selected upon presentation to the Aga Khan University Hospital
in a non-probabilistic manner. Upon selection, patients will be randomised to
one of the following three study groups:

- Standard Dressing
- EUSOL Dressing
- Opportunistic EUSOL Dressing

Randomisation will be stratified according to diabetic status. Cases will be
matched with controls on the basis of diabetic status, smoking status and wound
size.

## Inclusion Criteria

This study will include patients of all ages with wounds of any size healing by
secondary intention.

## Exclusion Criteria

- Wounds resulting from viscero-cutaneous fistula

    The healing of these wounds depends not only on wound care but also on
    interventions to control the output of the fistula. Such interventions are
    difficult to standardize as well as difficult to measure in a standardised
    fashion. Furthermore, different patients may respond differently to these
    interventions making measurement of treatment effect of dressings alone very
    difficult

- Wounds resulting from pre-existing dermatological pathology ???

## Confounders

- Age
- Diabetes
- Steroid Use
- Smoking Status
- Wound Size
